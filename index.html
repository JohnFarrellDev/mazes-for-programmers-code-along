        <p>
          While working through the book Mazes for Programmers (by James Buck,
          2015) I will be writing my own code to understand the concepts deeply
          and learn something new. The aim will be to purely look at the
          concepts in the book initially before implementing my own solutions,
          ideally avoiding taking code solutions from the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is built with plain HTML, CSS and TypeScript (bundle with
          Vite). I believe taking a "vanilla" approach will help me learn some
          new concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also going to utilise TypeScript classes more than I typically
          would, normally my frontend development code heavily relies on
          functions split between modules.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also expect it is likely I will have to learn a lot more about the
          canvas API and possible WebGL as the later chapters incorporate
          applying mazes to three dimensional objects.
